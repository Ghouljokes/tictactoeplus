There was a video tutorial on how to make tic-tac-toe in python.
I saw this video tutorial and immediately knew I could do better.
Introducing Tic-Tac-Toe+, the tic-tac-toe of the future.
It has all the classic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay you know and love, but with some added improvements such AS:
    Variable board size- 3x3 too limiting? How about 3x4? or 5x5? or 3x50? The sky (and your patience) is the limit...
    Difficulty select - Select from four difficulties for your ai opponent.
        Easy will pretty much always make the worst move possible. You have to try to lose to it.
        Medium will block your streaks and try to complete its own, and choose random squares otherwise.
        Master will always choose the best possible move. Pretty much unbeatable at 3x3.
        Chaotic will choose a method from any of the three other difficulties at random.

RULES:
    Each player takes a turn to place a number on the board. The first to build a streak of their letters across the board wins.
    For this program's purposes, a streak refers to a full row, full column, or full line originating from one of the four corners.

Running:
    Just have all these bad boys in one folder and then run tictactoe.py

NOTES:
       Once the sizes begin hitting 8x8, anything other than medium difficulty will begin to take a while. Just be aware.
